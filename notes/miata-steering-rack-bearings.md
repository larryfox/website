If you're depowering or rebuilding the power steering rack in your NA Miata and want to replace the pinion bearings these are the part numbers, at least for a 1990.

- Upper bearing in the seal at the top of the pinion shaft: [6804]
- Lower bearing at the bottom of the pinion shaft: [16001]
- Middle bearing inside the pinion shaft: Unsure, mine felt fine after regreasing

For the upper bearing an 11/16th socket works great to press it out of the seal housing. You'll likely damage the rubber seal doing this but you can find a replacement in a [rack and pinon seal kit]. I used a sealed bearing ([6804DD]) for additional protection from the elements, but it's open from factory.

The lower bearing is not press fit and should come out with minimal effort.
